# Snake Game
This is a classic arcade-style game, implemented using Python's Turtle module, where the player controls a snake that moves around a game board, eating food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

This game was created as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge.

## How to Play
To start the game, run the **main.py** file. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the direction of the snake's movement. The objective is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with its own body.

## Files
This project consists of the following files:

* **main.py**: This is the main file that runs the game.
* **snake.py**: This file contains the code for the Snake class, which handles the snake's movement and behavior.
* **food.py**: This file contains the code for the Food class, which handles the creation and placement of food on the game board.
* **scoreboard.py**: This file contains the code for the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the player's score and high score.
## Dependencies
This game requires Python 3.x and the Turtle module, which is included in the standard library.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the classic Snake game and is an implementation of the game taught in the "100 Days of Code" course.
