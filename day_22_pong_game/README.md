# Pong Game
This Pong game was created as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. It is a classic two-player game that involves bouncing a ball back and forth between two paddles. Each time the ball misses a paddle, the opposing player earns a point. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.

## Getting Started
You will need to install the Turtle module, which comes pre-installed with Python.

To start the game, simply run the **main.py** file.

## How to Play
Player 1 uses the Up and Down arrow keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively. Player 2 uses the W and S keys to move their paddle up and down.

The game ends when one player reaches 5 points. To restart the game, simply close the game window and run the **main.py** file again.

## Credits
This project was completed as part of the "100 Days of Code" course. The course provided the basis for the application, which I then customized and added additional features to.
