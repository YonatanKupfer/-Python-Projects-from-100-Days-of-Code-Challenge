# Pomodoro Timer
This project is a Pomodoro Timer GUI built in Python using the tkinter module. The timer alternates between work time, short break time, and long break time, and displays the countdown time on a tomato image in the center of the GUI. When the timer reaches 0, it switches to the next time interval and displays the number of completed intervals. The "Start" button starts the timer, and the "Reset" button resets the timer and clears the completed intervals.

This project was created as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge, which is a challenge where you code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and build a portfolio of projects.

## Installation
You will also need to install the tkinter module, which should come pre-installed with Python. If it's not installed on your system, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

``pip install tkinter``

Once you have Python and tkinter installed, you can run the project by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

``python main.py``

This will open the Pomodoro Timer GUI, and you can start using it right away.

## Usage
To use the Pomodoro Timer, simply click the "Start" button to start the timer. The timer will automatically switch between work time, short break time, and long break time, depending on the number of completed intervals.

You can reset the timer and clear the completed intervals by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The Pomodoro Technique is a great way to improve focus and productivity, and this project aims to bring the technique to the digital age with a simple and easy-to-use GUI.

This project was completed as part of the "100 Days of Code" course. The course provided the basis for the application, which I then customized and added additional features to.
