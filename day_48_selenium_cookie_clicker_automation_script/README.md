## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that automates playing the "Cookie Clicker" game using Selenium, a popular web automation library. The script will run the game for five minutes, clicking on the cookie to earn money, and purchasing various upgrades based on available funds.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver

You can install Selenium using pip:

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script file (`main.py`).
2. Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the Dependencies section.
3. Place the Chrome WebDriver executable in the same directory as the script file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

```

6. The script will start automating the "Cookie Clicker" game in a new Chrome browser window.

**Note**: The game automation will run for exactly five minutes, and then it will stop. During the automation, you can observe the script clicking on the cookie, buying upgrades, and monitoring the game's progress.
