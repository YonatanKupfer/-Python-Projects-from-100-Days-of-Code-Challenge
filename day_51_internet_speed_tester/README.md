3. The script will open a Chrome browser window and navigate to the Speedtest.net website.

4. After a brief pause, the script will initiate the speed test by clicking the "Go" button on the website.

5. Wait for the speed test to complete. This may take some time (around 80 seconds).

6. Once the speed test is finished, the script will print the results on the console, displaying your download and upload speeds in Mbps (megabits per second).
