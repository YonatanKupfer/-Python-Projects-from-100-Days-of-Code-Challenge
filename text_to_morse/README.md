# Morse Code Converter

## Overview
This simple Python script allows you to convert text to Morse Code and vice versa. It includes functionality for both encryption (text to Morse Code) and decryption (Morse Code to text).

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt:
    - To encrypt: Enter 'e' and provide the text message to be converted to Morse Code.
    - To decrypt: Enter 'd' and provide the Morse Code message to be converted to text.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your message.
4. View the result, either in Morse Code or plain text.

## Morse Code Dictionary
The Morse Code dictionary (`MORSE_CODE_DICT`) used in the script is provided in the script file. This dictionary maps characters (letters, numbers, and some punctuation) to their Morse Code representations.

## Files
- `main.py`: The Python script for text-to-Morse Code and Morse Code-to-text conversion.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the script and instructions for use.

## Notes
- The script uses a dictionary for Morse Code mapping and supports letters (uppercase), numbers, and some common punctuation.
- The reversed dictionary (`reversed_dict`) is used for decrypting Morse Code back to text.

Feel free to use, modify, and share this script as needed!
